PoEasyTrade is a powerful macro that allows you to effectively trade currency in Path of Exile.
PET works as follows:
- does nothing until turned on;
- enable it via hotkey (Num2 is default, choose yours! - https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm);
- your left mouse button now fires rapid click events when you hold it;
- use hotkey to turn it off.
This is considered third-party tool and should be used with caution.
*To change the hotkey button, open .ahk file with Notepad and change Num2 to your hotkey. Save the file and enjoy!
